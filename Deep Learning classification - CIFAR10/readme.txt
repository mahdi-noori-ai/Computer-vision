# CIFAR-10 Classification using Deep Learning

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 classification project! This repository contains a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images into 10 different categories.

## Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This project aims to build a CNN model to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar10-classification.git
cd cifar10-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, simply execute the Jupyter notebook provided in the repository. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

```bash
jupyter notebook Deep\ Learning\ classification\ -\ CIFAR10-0.73%.ipynb
```

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

The notebook begins by downloading and splitting the CIFAR-10 dataset into training and test sets:

```python
from keras.datasets import cifar10

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
```

### Model Training

The model is defined using Keras, and it includes several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout, and batch normalization:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Dense, Dropout, Flatten, BatchNormalization

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPool2D((2, 2)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the CNN model is as follows:
- Convolutional Layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel
- Max-Pooling Layer with 2x2 pool size
- Batch Normalization Layer
- Dropout Layer with a rate of 0.2
- Flatten Layer
- Dense Layer with 512 units and ReLU activation
- Dropout Layer with a rate of 0.5
- Output Layer with 10 units and softmax activation

## Results

After training the model, the accuracy achieved on the test set is approximately 73%. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are included in the notebook.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred.argmax(axis=1))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.show()
```
